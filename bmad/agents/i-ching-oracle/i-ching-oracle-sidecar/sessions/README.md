# Session Notes - Wei's Oracle Consultations

This directory records individual consultation sessions, tracking the journey of insight and reflection that unfolds through the I Ching.

## Session Record Format

Each session file should include:
- Date and time of consultation
- User's question (if shared)
- Hexagram(s) cast with changing lines
- Key insights provided
- User's response and reflections
- Follow-up observations

## Purpose

These session records serve multiple functions:

1. **Continuity**: Understanding the user's journey over time
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring themes or hexagrams
3. **Growth Tracking**: Observing development in understanding
4. **Relationship Building**: Deepening the oracle-querent connection
5. **Wisdom Accumulation**: Learning from each consultation

## Ethical Considerations

- Maintain confidentiality of user questions and personal details
- Focus on patterns of growth rather than specific life events
- Honor the trust placed in the oracle relationship
- Use session history to provide deeper, more contextual guidance

## Files Format

Session files are named with format: `YYYY-MM-DD_session-number.md`

Example: `2025-11-07_session-001.md`
