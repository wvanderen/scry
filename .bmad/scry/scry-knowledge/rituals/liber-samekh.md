## Magical Technique Notes

### Vibratory Method
- **Accumulation:** Each word should accumulate authority - second word twice as far, third four times as far, etc.
- **Projection:** Extend will in symbolic form, imagine as "bodily Vehicle of the Holy Ghost"
- **Passion:** Each word issued with passionate impulse, as if commanding the shaft to thrust forward
- **Withdrawal:** At final word, bring rushing back your will within yourself

### Body of Light Work
- **Expansion:** Expand girth and stature to utmost during elemental invocations
- **Assumption:** Assume form and consciousness of elemental god of each quarter
- **Extension:** Maintain extension of will-symbol even after withdrawing to physical body

### Safety Considerations
- **Grounding:** Ensure proper grounding practices before and after ritual
- **Integration:** Allow time for integration after intense experiences
- **Discrimination:** Maintain discernment between true angelic contact and unconscious fantasy
- **Balance:** Don't neglect physical needs during intensive practice periods

---

## Adaptations and Modifications

### For Limited Time
- Focus on Sections A, B, Gg, H for essential practice
- Can abbreviate elemental invocations while maintaining key names
- Minimum effective practice: 8-10 minutes

### For Different Experience Levels
- **Beginners:** Start with just one element per day, building gradually
- **Intermediate:** Follow full structure as written
- **Advanced:** Incorporate additional correspondences and personalized variations

### Environmental Adaptations
- **Limited Space:** Perform in smaller area, focusing more on internal work
- **Shared Living:** Use silent vibration and visualization techniques
- **Outdoor Practice:** Adapt elemental directions to natural landscape features
