## Structured & Enhanced Version

### Ritual Overview

**Type:** Opening/Alignment ritual
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes
**Best practiced:** Before scrying, devotional work, or spirit communication
**Pairs with:** Prayer to Hekate to Open the Gates of Spirit, general temple opening
**Tradition:** Greek magical practice via Jason Miller's work

### Purpose & Context

The Compass Rounds establishes you as the nexus point where celestial and chthonic forces meet. By invoking the four winds (spirits of the upper world) and four underworld rivers (spirits of the lower world), you become the axis mundi—the central pillar connecting all realms.

This is particularly powerful as a Hekate-aligned practice, as she is the goddess of crossroads and liminal spaces. By becoming the conflux of winds and rivers, you embody the crossroads itself.

### Required Materials

- **None required** (purely vocalized/energetic)
- **Optional:** Standing or seated position facing your altar
- **Optional:** Gesture to each direction as you call them

### Preparation

1. **Ground and center** - Take a few breaths to arrive in your body
2. **Face your primary working direction** (typically East or toward your altar)
3. **Stand with feet shoulder-width apart** or sit in a stable position
4. **Visualize yourself at the center** of a compass rose extending infinitely in all directions

### The Rite - Step by Step

**Opening Invocation** (speak with intention and authority):

*"I conjure the divine cup, the graal of gods, which holds all things!
I conjure the god of aeons, aeon of all!
Open the pylons of the heavens!
Open the pylons of the earth!
Open the gates of the horizon!"*

**Establishing the Nexus:**

*"Let me become the nexus of all—the conflux of the winds and rivers"*

**Calling the Eight Directions** (turn or gesture to each as you name them):

**North:** *"At the North: Boreas"* (the North Wind)
**North East:** *"At the North East: Acheron"* (River of Woe)
**East:** *"At the East: Eurus"* (the East Wind)
**South East:** *"At the South East: Cocytus"* (River of Lamentation)
**South:** *"At the South: Notos"* (the South Wind)
**South West:** *"At the South West: Phlegethon"* (River of Fire)
**West:** *"At the West: Zephyrus"* (the West Wind)
**North West:** *"At the North West: Styx"* (River of Hate/Oaths)

**Integration** (speak with fullness, drawing the energies into yourself):

*"Let the winds descend from the heavens
Let the rivers ascend from the underworld
Let them meet and meld within me"*

**Completion:**

- **Pause** - Feel the convergence of forces within and around you
- **Sense** the eight-pointed star or compass rose extending from your center
- **Breathe** - You are now aligned and oriented to the spiritual dimension
- **Proceed** to your main working (scrying, devotional, etc.)

### Energetic Notes

**The Winds (Cardinal Directions):**
- **Boreas (North):** Cold, harsh, clear-seeing
- **Eurus (East):** Dawn, beginnings, revelation
- **Notos (South):** Heat, passion, transformation
- **Zephyrus (West):** Gentle, twilight, completion

**The Rivers (Intercardinal Directions):**
- **Acheron (NE):** Boundary between worlds, transition
- **Cocytus (SE):** Mourning, release, catharsis
- **Phlegethon (SW):** Purifying fire, burning away
- **Styx (NW):** Sacred oaths, binding, integrity

### Adaptation Options

**For brief practice:**
- Skip the opening invocation, proceed directly to calling the eight directions

**For deeper work:**
- Spend time visualizing each spirit as you call them
- Physically turn to face each direction
- Feel each wind/river's unique quality as it arrives
- Pause longer at the integration to fully embody the nexus point

**For Hekate devotional:**
- Add after completion: "I stand at the crossroads, Hekate Triodia, guide my vision and open the ways"
- Pair with lighting a candle for the goddess
- Follow with Prayer to Hekate to Open the Gates of Spirit

**For seasonal variation:**
- Emphasize the seasonal wind (Boreas in winter, Zephyrus in spring, etc.)
- Note which river feels strongest based on your current emotional/spiritual state

### Safety & Grounding

**This ritual opens you as a conduit** - ensure you have:
- A clear intention for your working
- A plan to close/ground after your main practice
- Basic energetic hygiene (banishing, cleansing) in your toolkit

**Post-ritual grounding:**
- If you feel too open or scattered after your working, close with a simple banishing (LBRP, Sphere of Hekas)
- Eat something grounding
- Touch the earth or floor with both palms
