The Call of BABALON

An evocation and invocation of Babalon by two operants: Magus and Seer.

Objectives include dwelling in the gnosis of Babalon, experiencing her divinity directly, and
receiving information from her. There is plenty of room for improvisation.
Prepare the temple by adorning it with Babalon-correspondent accouterments. The color red,
roses, her star, statuary, art, incense, candles.
Conceive of a wish or intention for Babalon to fulfill.
Cast a circle large enough to comfortably fit both aspirants.
Set aside paper and pen within reach from the edge of the circle.
Set aside an offering of food and/or drink, also within reach.
Place a scrying device inside the Western edge of the circle.
The Magus stands in the center of the circle, facing East.
The Seer stands outside the Western edge of the circle, also facing East.
The Magus performs the Star Ruby. Upon reaching the part where they would whisper
“Babalon”, they instead vibrate the name powerfully toward the Seer.
The Seer begins assuming the godform of Babalon, a process which will last the duration of the
ritual (not just the Star Ruby, but this entire series of operations) and climax with the channeling
of, and/or possession by, Babalon.
The Magus completes the Star Ruby.
The Magus recites the Bornless Invocation.
The Magus says:
“Mother of Abominations, Scarlet Woman, Womb from whence we came and to which we shall
return - be thou adored! Seven letters are your name, holy of holies, BABALON. In adoration
and reverence, love and lust, we call upon you to enter this temple and grace us with your
divine presence. Appear before the Seer, and make yourself known!”
The Seer sits inside the circle, in front of the scrying implement.
The Magus stands behind the Seer and draws the Star of Babalon in the air.
The Magus retreats to the center of the circle, still facing West.
The Magus and Seer vibrate BABALON seven times, the Magus performing the Sign of the
Enterer each time.
The Magus and Seer hold the Sign of Silence until signs of Babalon’s manifestation occur.
The Seer scries into the device, or toward any position that Babalon indicates.
The Seer narrates their clairvoyant experiences.
…
The Magus provides the offering to the Seer, who sets it before Babalon.
The Seer voices their wish to Babalon, followed by the Magus.
The Magus says:
“Great Goddess, look favorably upon the vessel before you, and take flesh, bone, and blood
within.”
The Seer says:
Take up this house! In nomine Babalon! IO Babalon! Ave Babalon!
The Seer stands and turns toward the Magus, allowing Babalon to flood their consciousness
and fill their body. With their last remaining sense of individuality, they proclaim:
“Thou hast called me, oh accursed and beloved fool.
Now know that I, Babalon, would take flesh and come among men.
I will come as a pendulous flame, as a devious song, a trumpet in judgment halls, a banner
before armies.
And gather my children unto me, for the time is at hand.
And this is the way of my incarnation. Heed!
Thou shalt offer all thou art and all thou hast at my altar, withholding nothing.”
The Magus communicates directly with Babalon, recording any answers or revelations.
…
Before departing, Babalon consumes the offering using the Seer’s body.
When ready to conclude the working, the Magus recites The Birth of Babalon:

What is the tumult among the stars
that have shone so still till now?
What are the furrows of pain and wrath
upon the immortal brow?
Why is the face of God turned grey
and his angels all grown white?
What is the terrible ruby star
that burns down the crimson night?
What is the beauty that flames so bright
athwart the awful dawn?
She has taken flesh, she is come to judge
the thrones ye rule upon.
Quail ye kings for an end is come
in the birth of BABALON.
I have walked three dreadful nights away
in halls beyond despair,
I have given marrow and tears and sweat
and blood to make her fair.
I have lain my love and smashed my heart
and filled her cup with blood,
That blood might flow from the loins of woe
to the cup of brotherhood.
The cities reel in the shout of steel
where the sword of war is drawn.
Sing ye saints for the day is come
in the birth of BABALON.
Now God has called for his judgment book
and seen his name therein
And the grace of God and the guilt of God
have spelt it out as sin
His bloody priests have clutched his robes
and stained his linen gown
And his victims swarm from his broken hell
to drag his kingdom down.
O popes and kings and the little gods
are sick and sad and wan
To see the crimson star that bursts
like blood upon the dawn
While trumpets sound and stars rejoice
at the birth of BABALON.
BABALON is too beautiful
for sight of mortal eyes
She has hidden her loveliness away
in lonely midnight skies,
She has clothed her beauty in robes of sin
and pledged her heart to swine
And loving and giving all she has
brewed for saints immortal wine.
But now the darkness is riven through
and the robes of sin are gone,
And naked she stands as a terrible blade
and a flame and a splendid song
Naked in radiant mortal flesh
at the Birth of BABALON.
She is come new born as a mortal maid
forgetting her high estate,
She has opened her arms to pain and death
and dared the doom of fate,
And death and hell are at her back,
but her eyes are bright with life,
Her heart is high and her sword is strong
to meet the deadly strife,
Her voice is sure as the judgment trump
to crack the house of wrong,
Though walls are high and stone is hard
and the rule of hell was long
The gates shall fall and the irons break
in the Birth of BABALON.
Her mouth is red and her breasts are fair
and her loins are full of fire,
And her lust is strong as a man is strong
in the heat of her desire,
And her whoredom is holy as virtue is foul
beneath the holy sky,
And her kisses will wanton the world away
in passion that shall not die.
Ye shall laugh and love and follow her
dance
when the wrath of God is gone
And dream no more of hell and hate
in the Birth of BABALON.
