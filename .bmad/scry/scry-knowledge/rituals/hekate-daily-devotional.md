Repeat the following mantra as many times as possible. One hundred times minimum; one thousand times is preferable.

IO HEKA IO HO

When you feel that the presence of Hekate has been evoked and stabilized into your sphere through the call and the mantra, you can move on to the offerings. This can be as simple as rubbing your hands together and offering the heat from your hands, or can involve a simple offering of incense and libation poured into the ground. This is a daily practice, so keep it simple.

I THANK YOU, HEKATE, FOR YOUR PRESENCE AND BLESSING.
AND FOR THE BLESSINGS YOU HAVE GIVEN I GIVE OFFERING AND PRAISE TO YOU IN ALL YOUR FORMS
I GIVE OFFERING AND THANKS TO THE UNTIMELY DEAD WHO FOLLOW YOU
I GIVE OFFERING AND THANKS TO THE SPIRITS UNDER YOUR COMMAND
MAY ALL BE PLEASED. MAY ALL BE AT PEACE.
