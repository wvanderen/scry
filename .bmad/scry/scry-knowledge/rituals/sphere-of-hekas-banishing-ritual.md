## Structured & Enhanced Version

### Overview and Purpose

This is a powerful banishing ritual that invokes the protective authority of **Hekate** to clear negative energies, establish sacred boundaries, and summon guardian spirits. The ritual combines Greco-Roman magical elements with modern ceremonial techniques, creating a multi-layered approach to protection and purification.

**Primary Functions:**
- Personal grounding and centering between Earth and Heaven
- Clearing and banishing malefic forces and harmful spirits
- Creating an impenetrable sphere of protection
- Invoking four directional guardians aligned with Hekate's retinue

**Ideal Timing:**
- When establishing sacred space before other workings
- During times of spiritual or psychic disturbance
- As regular maintenance for energetic hygiene
- Before intense magical operations requiring strong boundaries

**Estimated Duration:** 10-15 minutes

---

### Required Materials and Setup

**Essential:**
- Clear space with room to move (minimum 6-8 foot diameter)
- Ability to face and turn to each cardinal direction

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Wand or athame (ritual knife) for circle delineation
- Compass or knowledge of cardinal directions in your space
- Quiet environment where you won't be disturbed

**Physical Setup:**
1. Clear the center of your ritual space
2. Identify the cardinal directions (East, South, West, North)
3. Ensure you have enough room to extend arms fully
4. Have your wand/athame within easy reach if using one
5. Consider dimming lights or using candlelight for atmosphere

**Mental Preparation:**
- Ground and center yourself with a few deep breaths
- Set clear intention for the banishing work
- Release attachment to outcomes; trust the process
- Approach with respectful confidence in Hekate's power

### Part 1: Conjuring the Column (3-5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Ground yourself in sacred space, connect Earth and Sky, activate your energetic centers.

**The Practice:**

Stand facing east at the center of your space. Establish the awareness that you are at the very center of the universe—not imaginatively transported elsewhere, but recognizing that *where you stand* is the cosmic center from which all revolves.

**White Light Descent:**
- Take a deep inhalation
- Visualize pure white light descending from the highest heavens
- See it enter through your crown and flow down through your body into the earth
- Feel its purifying, centering qualities
- Exhale and intone: **DECENDAT COLUMBA!** (The descent of the dove!)

**Red Light Ascent:**
- Inhale deeply again
- Visualize reddish light rising from beneath you through the column
- Feel it pass upward through your body with vitalizing energy
- Exhale and intone: **ASCENDAT SERPENS!** (The ascent of the serpent!)

**Integration:**
- Inhale, feeling both energies entering from above and below simultaneously
- Exhale, allowing the energies to flow throughout every cell of your being
- Feel your connection: Earth and Sky, Underworld and Heavens united in you

**The IAO Formula:**
- Point your right hand at your third eye and intone: **I** (ee)
- Move your hand to your heart, palm facing chest, and intone: **A** (ah)
- Move your hand to your genitals, palm upward, thumb and forefinger touching, intone: **O** (oh)

**Adaptation Notes:**
- If standing is difficult, this can be performed seated with visualized energy flow
- The IAO can be internalized if vocalizing isn't possible
- Focus on the feeling of connection even if visualization is challenging

---

### Part 2: Delineating the Boundaries (3-4 minutes)

**Purpose:** Clear malefic forces, establish protective boundary, create sacred container.

**The Practice:**

**Proclamation:**
Still standing within the column, declare to all forces present:
**HEKAS HEKAS ESTE BEBELOI!** (Away, away, all ye profane!)

**Sphere Formation:**
- Make a fist with your left hand, place it over your heart
- Cover it with your right hand
- Apply steady pressure (about 5 pounds)
- Visualize the column's power concentrating at your heart as a gray sphere about the size of a baseball
- Hold this visualization clearly

**Sphere Expansion:**
- Release the pressure
- Step forward with your left foot
- Throw both arms outward in the Sign of the Enterer (arms extended, palms forward)
- See the sphere expand rapidly, pushing back all malefic forces and harmful spirits
- Feel it grow past your body to your desired boundary (edge of room or beyond)
- It forms a wall of grayish protective astral force
- Intone: **GYRUM CARPO!** (I seize the circle!)

**Circle Consecration:**
- Take your wand, athame, or use your dominant hand's index finger
- Extend your arm so the tool/finger touches the edge of your circle
- Walk or pivot clockwise around the circle's edge, maintaining the visualization
- As you trace the boundary, intone:

**CONSECRO ET BENEDICO ISTUM CIRCULUM**
**UT SIT MIHI ET OMNIBUS SCUTUM AT**
**PROTECTIE DEI FORTISSIMI HEKATE INVICIBILE**

(I consecrate and bless this circle / That it may be to me and all a shield / And protection in the name of the most powerful invincible goddess Hekate)

- Complete the full circle, returning to the east
- Feel the sphere as an invisible, impenetrable fortress keeping out all harmful forces

**Adaptation Notes:**
- If space is limited, trace a smaller circle or visualize only
- The sphere can be expanded mentally without physical movement if needed
- Gray coloring represents neutralization; some practitioners prefer white or blue

---

### Part 3: Invoking the Guardians (4-6 minutes)

**Purpose:** Call upon four guardian spirits from Hekate's retinue to stand watch at each quarter, reinforcing protection.

**Important:** These guardians are fierce protectors. Approach with respect and clarity of purpose.

**East - Abaek (Bull-Headed Guardian):**
- Face east
- Visualize Abaek at the eastern edge, initially facing the center
- Man's body, bull's head snorting and breathing wildly
- Holds two scimitars, clashing them together threateningly
- Make a gesture of conjuring (arms raised, commanding presence)
- Invoke:

***ORKIZO ABAEK!***
*Bull-headed guardian of the East*
*Remember your vow and fill the throne*
*which has been set for you!*

- See Abaek fill the visualization and turn to face outward, guarding

**South - Pyrhum (Horse-Headed Guardian):**
- Face south
- Visualize Pyrhum at the southern edge, initially facing the center
- Man's body, horse's head breathing fire
- Holds a large ebony trident
- Make a gesture of conjuring
- Invoke:

***ORKIZO PYRHUM!***
*Horse-headed guardian of the South*
*Remember your vow and fill the throne*
*which has been set for you!*

- See Pyrhum fill the visualization and turn to face outward, guarding

**West - Ermiti (Serpentine Guardian):**
- Face west
- Visualize Ermiti at the western edge, initially facing the center
- Woman's torso, serpent's head and lower body
- Holds a net and a skull-cup overflowing with boiling blood
- Make a gesture of conjuring
- Invoke:

***ORKIZO ERMITI!***
*Serpentine guardian of the West*
*Remember your vow and fill the throne*
*which has been set for you!*

- See Ermiti fill the visualization and turn to face outward, guarding

**North - Dimgali (Dog-Headed Guardian):**
- Face north
- Visualize Dimgali at the northern edge, initially facing the center
- Woman's torso, black dog's head
- Left hand holds a whip, right hand holds adamantine shackles
- Make a gesture of conjuring
- Invoke:

***ORKIZO DIMGALI!***
*Bitch-headed guardian of the North*
*Remember your vow and fill the throne*
*which has been set for you!*

- See Dimgali fill the visualization and turn to face outward, guarding

**Adaptation Notes:**
- "ORKIZO" means "I conjure/adjure" - feel the authority in this word
- If visualization is challenging, focus on the feeling of presence in each direction
- The "throne" is your visualization offering them a place to manifest
- These are protective, not malevolent beings—they respond to respectful command

---

### Part 4: Closing and Sealing (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Seal the work, acknowledge the completeness of the protection established.

**The Practice:**

- Return to facing east (or remain at north)
- Take a single deep breath, centering in the completed work
- Bring your hands together before your heart in a prayer position
- Feel gratitude for the protection established
- Intone with finality:

***PROCUL HINC PROCUL ITE PROFANI***
***PER NOMINA DEI ATISSIMI HEKATE***

(Away, away, all ye profane / In the name of the most powerful HEKATE)

**Integration:**
- Take a moment to feel the complete sphere of protection around you
- Notice the guardians at each quarter standing watch
- Feel the column still running through you, connecting heaven and earth
- Trust that the work is complete

**The Space is Now:**
- Cleared of harmful energies and entities
- Protected by an astral barrier
- Guarded by Hekate's four directional spirits
- Safe for meditation, ritual work, or rest

---

### Post-Ritual Grounding and Care

**Immediate After-Care:**
- Take 2-3 normal breaths, returning to ordinary consciousness gradually
- Stretch or move your body gently
- Drink water to ground yourself physically
- Sit for a moment if needed to stabilize

**Maintaining the Space:**
- The sphere and guardians typically remain for the duration of your working
- For longer-term protection, this ritual can be repeated daily or weekly
- The space will naturally dissipate over time (hours to days depending on intensity)
- To actively dismiss: thank the guardians, visualize the sphere contracting back to your heart

**Safety Considerations:**
- If you feel dizzy or ungrounded, sit down and breathe deeply
- Physical pressure on the chest should be moderate, not painful
- If working with new guardian spirits feels overwhelming, start with shorter visualizations
- Ground thoroughly after any banishing work—eat something, touch the earth, physical activity

**Troubleshooting:**
- *Can't visualize clearly:* Focus on feeling rather than seeing; trust your intention
- *Lost count of directions:* Simply reorient and continue; the guardians understand
- *Interrupted mid-ritual:* Close with the final proclamation even if incomplete
- *Space doesn't feel clear:* Repeat the ritual or follow with additional cleansing (salt, sound, etc.)

### Variations and Adaptations

**For Brief Daily Practice:**
- Perform Part 1 (Column) and Part 2 (Sphere) only
- Acknowledge the guardians mentally without full invocation
- Use abbreviated Latin if pressed for time

**For Intensive Protection Work:**
- Add offerings to Hekate before beginning (incense, wine, garlic, keys)
- Spend more time with each guardian, building relationship
- Repeat the sphere expansion in Part 2 multiple times
- Add a personal prayer to Hekate between Parts 3 and 4

**For Group Practice:**
- Designate one person to lead, others to participate in unison
- Circle can be traced with all members standing at the edge
- Guardians can be invoked by different people at each quarter
- Close with all hands joined in the center

**Minimal/Travel Version:**
- Perform seated or lying down
- All movements and gestures internalized
- Whisper or mentally intone the invocations
- Visualize a smaller protective sphere (around your bed, hotel room, etc.)

**Integration with Other Practices:**
- Use before meditation, trance work, or divination
- Excellent foundation before Hekate devotionals or offerings
- Can precede LBRP or other banishing rituals for layered protection
- Effective before entering challenging or negative environments
