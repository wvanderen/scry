## Variations and Advanced Techniques

### Color Correspondences

**Black - Saturn/Binah**
- Binding, protection, banishing
- Binding formula: "In the divine name **YHVH Elohim** I ask that this person be bound so they cause me no harm and be banished from my life in a way that brings harm to none and is for the good of all and in no way let this reverse or bring me or them any curse"

**Green - Venus/Netzach**
- Wealth, pleasure, enthusiasm, joy, life, money

**Yellow - Sun/Tiphareth**
- Radiance, power, health, divinity, individuality

**Red - Mars/Geburah**
- Power, energy, smashing obstacles, destructive ability, clearing out the unneeded

**Reference:** Consult Liber 777 for comprehensive correspondences

### Adding Divine Name Vibrations

During each exhale of the LVX signs, vibrate the corresponding divine name:
- Saturn/Binah: **YHVH ELOHIM**
- Venus/Netzach: **YHVH TZABAOTH**
- Sun/Tiphareth: **YHVH ELOAH VA-DAATH**
- Mars/Geburah: **ELOHIM GIBOR**
- (See Liber 777 for complete list)

### Remote Working

You can call down the light to places where you are not physically present:
- Focus on the person's energy/essence rather than physical location
- Can be used for healing or binding from a distance
- Visualization of the person/place is sufficient

### Repeated Workings for Power

**40-Day Cycle (Spiritual Year)**
- For major spells, magical items, or tinctures
- Charge the object daily for 40 days
- Builds tremendous power through repetition
- Not required for all workings - use intuition

**Progressive Mastery**
- Practice daily or twice daily
- Energy becomes stronger over time
- Rite becomes easier with repetition
- Eventually becomes second nature

## Important Warnings and Safety

### Protecting Charged Objects

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT perform the LBRP around items you have charged with this ritual unless:
- They are put away in a closed container
- Covered with a cloth
- Removed from the space

**Reason:** The LBRP will deconsecrate charged items and undo your work.

### Grounding After

- Return to normal awareness slowly
- Ground any excess energy
- Record your experience while fresh
