## The Rite

### Opening: Center and Ground

*Take three deep breaths. Feel your connection to the earth beneath you and the vast sky above. Acknowledge your position as bridge between worlds, capable of offering hospitality to spirits.*

### Step 1: Purification of Offerings

Lay out your offerings (incense, libation, food). Extend your hands over them in a gesture of blessing.

**Elemental Consecration Sequence:**

Place hands over offerings and say:

*Fire of Fire, First of the Fire within me,
Burn away the impurities of the offering*

**Visualization:** See the offerings engulfed in purifying flames. Any impurities, mundane energies, or unwanted influences are consumed completely. The fire consecrates and transforms.

*Air of Air, first of the Air within me,
Extinguish the fire and separate the ash from offering*

**Visualization:** A strong wind arises, blowing out the flames. The wind carries away the ash of impurity and consecrates the offerings with the element of Air, bringing clarity and communication.

*Water of Water, first of the Water within me,
Cleanse this offering so that only subtle substance remains.*

**Visualization:** A torrent of pure water flows over and through the offerings, washing away all remaining ash and dense matter. Only the subtle essence, the spiritual substance, remains. The water consecrates with emotion and connection.

*Earth of Earth, first of Earth within me,
Multiply this offering that this sole support may fill the ten directions and satisfy all who seek sustenance*

**Visualization:** The offerings begin to multiply, expanding outward to fill the entire ritual space, then beyond—filling all directions, infinite abundance arising from finite matter. The earth consecrates with stability and nourishment.

*Spirit of Spirit, first of the Spirit within me,
Transform this offering into whatever is most desirable that it may please the six doors of sensation and delight my honored guest*

**Visualization:** The offerings shimmer and shift, becoming a template that will manifest as whatever each spirit finds most pleasing—the perfect gift, the ideal sustenance, the most delightful experience for each individual recipient.

### Step 2: Invitation of Guests

Speak with sincerity and respect, naming those entities most important to your practice:

*To the Gods and Goddesses,
Angels and Avatars,
Arch devils and glorified dead,
Most especially to (name your most important patrons and divine beings)*
*And to the overseeing powers of this land on which I dwell,
I give offerings of respect.*

*To the Ancestors, Guardians, Familiars, Saints, and potent allies I give thanks and offering,
Most especially (name your most important ancestors, protectors, and spirit allies)*
*I give offerings of gratitude.*

*To all beings of the sky, the land, the underworld,
To all sentient beings in all the ten directions and three times,
To beings of the elements, and all who wander the surface of the earth,
I give offerings of substance and nourishment.*

*To all beings to whom I owe a debt, and whom I have angered by mistaken or ignorant action,
I give offerings of supplication and pacification.*

**Adaptation Note:** Customize the naming sections based on your active relationships. Some practitioners maintain lists of specific entities to acknowledge. This can be shortened for daily practice or expanded for special feast days.

### Step 3: Offering and Multiplication

Make the Gesture of Offering (hands extended, palms up and outward, presenting the offerings). Light or tend the incense. Pour libation on the ground (outdoors) or into an offering bowl (indoors).

As you make physical offerings, say:

*Let the offerings arise and pervade all space,
Let it take the form that is most desired.*

*Enjoy! Enjoy!
Friends and family from former lives,
I am grateful for your past kindness.*

*Enjoy! Enjoy!
You who form obstacles as retribution to my action,
Forgive any offense made by mistake or delusion.*

*Enjoy! Enjoy!
Spirits of the dead and trapped in-between spaces,
Wardens of this ground and keepers of the winds.*

*Enjoy! Enjoy!
Guardians and familiars, be fulfilled,
Thank you for your aid.*

*Enjoy! Enjoy!
To each of you I offer inexhaustible treasures,
Delightful substances and enjoyments.
You who would harm me,
Partake of this feast and be at peace.
You who would help me be fulfilled.
So it is.*

**Visualization:** See the offerings multiplying infinitely, clouds of subtle substance filling all space and time, reaching every being you've called. Each spirit receives exactly what they most desire.

**Observation Phase (Optional but Recommended):**

Spend time in quiet observation. Watch the incense smoke—how does it move? What shapes or patterns emerge? Notice any sensations, images, or impressions. This is when spirits manifest their presence and communicate their acceptance or messages.

*Duration: 2-5 minutes minimum, or until you feel the communion is complete*

When ready, conclude:

*Enjoy the offerings,
Be pleased and fulfilled.*

### Step 4: License to Depart

Bow respectfully, as you would when leaving a gathering of honored guests:

*Honored guests of this temple, the window of our communion is closing and our feast is coming to an end.
Take your last taste of these enjoyments and go in peace.
Vacate the thrones of the feast and go forth unto your abodes and habitations as you desire.
Forever act as friends and helpers,
Accomplish all the deeds with which you have been charged,
By the power of the hand and eye,
And the arcana of the sacred arte,
So mote it be.*

### Closing: Fire Safety and Grounding

1. **Ensure all flames are safely extinguished**
2. Transfer ash from censer to mortar and pestle
3. Bury coal in bowl and verify it's fully extinguished before leaving
4. Ground any excess energy through earth connection or grounding practice
5. Make note of any significant experiences for your practice log
