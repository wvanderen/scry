## Rite

### I.

Facing East, in the centre, draw deep deep deep thy breath closing thy mouth with thy right forefinger prest against thy lower lip. Then dashing down the hand with a great sweep back and out, expelling forcibly thy breath, cry **APO PANTOS KAKODAIMONOS** [""Away, every evil spirit""].

With the same forefinger touch thy forehead, and say **SOI** [""Thine""], thy member, and say **Ô PhALLE** [""O Phallus""], thy right shoulder, and say **ISChUROS** [""the mighty""], thy left shoulder, and say **EUChARISTOS** [""the beneficient""]; then clasp thine hands, locking the fingers, and cry **IAÔ**.
### [III. Pentagrams]
Advance to the East. Imagine strongly a Pentagram, aright, in thy forehead. Drawing the hands to the eyes, fling it forth, making the sign of Horus and roar **ThÊRION**. Retire thine hand in the sign of Hoor-paar-Kraat.
Go round to the North and repeat; but say **NUIT**.
Go round to the West and repeat; but whisper **BABALON**.
Go round to the South and repeat; but bellow **HADIT**.

Completing the circle widdershins, retire to the centre and raise thy voice in the Paian, with these words **IÔ PAN**, with the [[Signs of N.O.X.]] -- **Puer, Vir, Puella, Mulier, Mater Triumphans** (in order)
### [V. Tau ]

## Notes:

This is one of the official rituals of the A∴A∴ It was first published by Frater Perdurabo in 1913 e.v., in a somewhat different form, as Chapter XXV of Liber CCCXXXIII, The Book of Lies. It was published in revised form in 1929 e.v. in Appendix VI of Book 4, Part III: Magick in Theory and Practice. In his commentary to Chapter XXV of The Book of Lies, Crowley described this ritual as ""a new and more elaborate version of the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram."" My notes and comments are unofficial and informal. They represent my personal opinions based on my own studies.

The term ""Phallus"" may be interpreted, in Crowley's words, as the ""immortal principle"" of either a man or a woman. It is the Principle of Life, continuously renewing itself through the cycle of death and generation.

IAO is the Gnostic form of the Tetragrammaton, IHVH. The individual letters Iota, Alpha, and Omega represent the Essence, the Beginning, and the End, respectively. Thus, IAO is the equivalent of the Hebrew phrase, _le-Olahm, Amen_ in the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. It is also a Divine Name of the sphere of Tiphareth, corresponding to the heart.

[[Therion]], [[Nuit]], [[Babalon]] and [[Hadit]] are divine names from the Holy Books of [[Thelema]]. The Signs of Horus and of Hoor-paar-Kraat (Harpocrates) are shown in Figure 33A,B on page 606 of _Magick: Liber ABA, Book Four, Parts I-IV_ by Aleister Crowley, Samuel Weiser 1994.

In classical terminology, a ""paian"" was a song of praise, especially to Apollo. In this case, the paian is to the Great God Pan, where PAN may be translated as ""All."" Also, the five letters I.O.P.A.N. correspond to the five N.O.X. signs, which are shown in Figure 33L-P on page 607 of _Magick_.

The Iynges (singular ""Iynx""), Synoches, Teletarches and Daemones are divine principles from the Second Order of the emanationist hierarchy of late Neoplatonism, based on the _Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster_. Their position in the Neoplatonist hierarchy is intermediate between the ""intelligible"" world, or world of ideation, and the ""sensible"" world, or world of perception. Their functions are, respectively, as ""initiators,"" ""maintainers,"" ""perfectors,"" and ""executors"" of the Divine Creative Impulse which originates in the intelligible world and ultimately manifests in the sensible world. Further information on them may be found in the published editions of the _Chaldean Oracles_ edited by W. Wynn Westcott and G.R.S. Mead, and in the works of Proclus, Damascius, Michael Psellus, George Gemistos Plethon, and other late Neoplatonist philosophers.

- End as you began with Section I (the breath and banishing gesture)

### Adaptations and Options

**For Limited Space:**
- Perform all gestures in place
- Use smaller, more contained movements
- Focus on intention rather than large physical expression

**For Quiet Practice:**
- Substitute vocalizations with whispered words
- Use mental projection of sound while mouthing words
- Focus on the vibration of the names internally

**Beginner Modifications:**
- Practice each section separately before combining
- Use a written script until memorized
- Allow extra time for each movement and vocalization

### Integration and Closing

**Post-Ritual Grounding:**
- Take three deep, grounding breaths
- Feel your feet connected to the earth
- Notice the quality of energy in the space
- Spend a few moments in silence observing any shifts

**Transition to Other Work:**
- The space is now prepared for meditation, scrying, or other magical operations
- Maintain the centered state as you proceed
- Return to the cross position if you need to re-center during subsequent work
