# Prayer to Hekate to Open the Gates of Spirit

**Created by:** Lem
**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Creation Mode:** quick
**Source:** Jason Miller (original prayer)
**Tradition/Context:** Hekatean devotional practice, spirit work, thresholds and gateways

## Purpose & Context

This is a simple yet potent prayer to Hekate asking her to aid you in opening your senses to the spirits and to bring spirits you call. If repeated regularly, it will change you over time, serving as a catalyst for spirit work. The prayer invokes Hekate in her many aspects - as keyholder, threshold guardian, queen of the dead, and teacher of sorcery - to facilitate communion with the spirit world.

**Recommended Practice:**
- **Frequency:** Daily for catalytic effect, or as needed for spirit work
- **Duration:** 5-15 minutes (basic), 20-30 minutes (with meditation)
- **Best Timing:** Evening, dark moon, or during liminal times (dawn, dusk, midnight)
- **Experience Level:** Suitable for all levels; deeper effects emerge with consistent practice

## Preparation

### Physical Setup
- **Minimal:** A quiet space where you won't be disturbed
- **Enhanced:** Altar or working space with:
  - Statue or icon of Hekate (optional)
  - Candle(s) - particularly appropriate for the torch-bearer
  - Incense (mugwort, wormwood, or traditional Hekatean offerings)
  - Offering bowl with appropriate offerings (honey, garlic, eggs, wine)

### Materials Needed
- **Basic practice:** None (the prayer itself is sufficient)
- **Enhanced practice:** As listed in Physical Setup
- **Talisman variation:** See Advanced Talisman section below

### Mental/Spiritual Preparation
- Clear intention for spirit work or opening spiritual senses
- Grounded and centered state
- Respectful, reverent attitude toward Hekate and the spirits
- Consider what spirits or ancestors you may wish to contact

### Safety Considerations
- Ensure you are grounded before beginning spirit work
- Have a closing/banishing practice ready if needed (LBRP, etc.)
- Set clear boundaries for spirit contact
- Keep protective practices in your toolkit
- Do not practice while emotionally unstable or intoxicated

## The Ritual

### Opening
1. Stand or sit comfortably in your prepared space
2. Take several deep breaths to center yourself
3. If using altar items, light candle and incense
4. Focus your attention on Hekate and your intention

### Main Prayer

Recite the following prayer with focus and reverence:

*Hail many named mother of the gods, whose children are fair
Hail mighty Hekate of the threshold, keyholder of the world
Hail to enodia, keeper of the four- and three-way crossroads
Nether, nocturnal and infernal one
I beckon to you, hear my plea
Night mother! Savior! Mistress of solitude!
Lady of light, and the darkness that contains it
You who walk disheveled and wild through tombs and cremation grounds
Cloaked in saffron, crowned with oak leaves and coils of serpents
You who are followed by hordes of ghosts, dogs, and restless spirits
Yet are also the luminous empress of the empyrian realms.
I beckon to you, hear my plea
Kleidokhous, grant me the key to the mysteries
Propylaia, throw open the gateway to the world of spirits
Phosphoros, light my way with your twin torches of mercy and severity
Propolos, steer me safely through the four rivers of spirit
Brimo, shake the pillars of perception with your wrath
Physis, bind all Demons and troublemaking spirits
Kleidokhous, grant me the key to the mysteries
Anassa eneroi, queen of the dead, bring me contact
With my Ancestors and the shades of Witches past.
Hekate Chthonia, Queen of Sorcery
Teacher of howlings and bindings, curses and blessings
Bring to me all spirits I call in your name
Whether they be dwelling in the earth or the underworld
In the swirling airs or highest heavens
In the fires or waters of anyplace anywhere
Bring them forth and grant me their conversation.*

### Integration & Deepening

**After reciting the prayer:**

1. **Silent Meditation** (3-5 minutes)
   - Spend time in silence, meditating on Hekate
   - Feel her presence and the opening of spiritual gateways
   - Notice any sensations, images, or impressions

2. **Chanting** (5-10 minutes, optional but powerful)
   - Begin chanting: **IO HEKA IO HO**
   - Repeat continuously, allowing it to lead you into trance
   - Let the rhythm build and carry you deeper
   - Continue until the chanting naturally completes itself

3. **Receptive Listening** (5-10 minutes)
   - When the chanting stops, sit in silence
   - Listen with all your senses
   - Reach out with your spiritual perception
   - Be open to contact, messages, or presences
   - Record any experiences immediately

### Closing

1. Thank Hekate for her presence and assistance
2. If you made offerings, leave them on the altar overnight
3. Ground yourself thoroughly (eat, drink, touch earth)
4. Record your experience in your practice log
