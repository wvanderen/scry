# Liber Abomina Desola Sub Figura DCCXVIII

By NFLM

## Purpose

The aim of this ceremony is to open the gate to the underworld, by which the aspirants may
perform magickal procedures with greater facility and efficacy.

---------------
## Preliminaries

This ritual is meant for two people, but can be adapted by the enthusiastic solo practitioner.
One mage plays the role of Ra-hoor-khuit (**RHK**), and wields a sword or dagger.
One mage plays the role of Ankh-af-an-khonsu (**AFNK**), and wields a wand, staff, or otherwise
Hierophantic implement. They also use a battery: a percussive tool such as a wood block.
The actors perform the incantations as a dialogue.

Place the Stele of Revealing on an East-facing altar.
Precede the ritual with an Offering Rite and partaking of meat, grain, and/or alcohol.
RHK begins the spell facing West, while AFNK faces East.
Use a magick circle, with the mages standing diametric.
RHK rotates during the invocatory procedures, while AFNK stays in place.

---

### Required Materials & Setup

**Physical Items:**
- The Stele of Revealing (image, reproduction, or representation)
- East-facing altar
- Sword or dagger (for RHK role)
- Wand, staff, or Hierophantic implement (for AFNK role)
- Battery (percussive instrument: wood block, sistrum, or drum)
- Offering materials: meat, grain, and/or alcohol
- Magick circle (drawn, painted, or visualized)
- Optional: Candles, incense appropriate to solar/chthonic work

**Space Preparation:**
1. Establish your temple space and ensure privacy for 45-60 minutes
2. Create or mark a magick circle large enough for two practitioners to stand diametrically
3. Place the Stele of Revealing on an East-facing altar
4. Arrange offerings on or near the altar
5. Position implements for easy access during the ritual
6. Ensure adequate lighting to read verses while maintaining ritual atmosphere

**Pre-Ritual Requirements:**

---

### Role Assignments

**Ra-hoor-khuit (RHK) - The Invoking Force:**
- Wields sword or dagger
- Begins facing West
- Rotates through cardinal directions during invocations
- Draws all hexagrams, pentagrams, and sigils
- Delivers odd-numbered verses (1, 7)
- Performs the final sealing slash

**Ankh-af-an-khonsu (AFNK) - The Hierophantic Voice:**
- Wields wand, staff, or Hierophantic implement
- Begins facing East (toward the Stele)
- Remains in place at circle center throughout
- Operates the battery
- Delivers even-numbered verses (2-6)
- Speaks for the priest/aspirant seeking entry

**Solo Adaptation:**
If practicing alone, you embody both roles sequentially:

- Deliver verses alternating between RHK voice (commanding) and AFNK voice (supplicating)
- Move to perform invocations as RHK (rotating through quarters)
- Return to center to deliver AFNK verses
- Complete the sealing as RHK

---

### The Complete Ritual Sequence

#### Part I: The Opening (Both Participants)

**Initial Position:**
- RHK stands at Western edge of circle, facing West
- AFNK stands at Eastern edge of circle, facing East (toward Stele)
- Both hold their implements

**The Opening Gesture Sequence:**

1. **Kether Invocation:** Point your implement upward above your crown chakra. Visualize infinite space. Vibrate strongly: **NUIT**

2. **Malkuth Grounding:** Bring your implement down to point at the earth below your feet. Visualize the kingdom of matter. Vibrate: **HADIT**

3. **Triangle of Art:** Before you, trace a fiery, red, averse (downward-pointing) triangle ▽ with your implement. Visualize it blazing in the air, a gateway to chthonic forces.

4. **Solar Shoulder:** Raise your implement over your right shoulder, parallel to your face, blade/tip pointing upward. Embody solar strength. Vibrate: **RA**

5. **Lunar Hand:** Simultaneously raise your left hand with index finger extended and pointing, parallel to your face. Embody lunar receptivity. Vibrate: **HOOR**

6. **The Thrust:** Step forward decisively on your left foot. Thrust both hands (implement and pointing finger) into the center of the visualized triangle.

7. **Channeling Flame:** As your hands meet at the triangle's center, visualize and FEEL a column of flame streaming through the triangle, through your body, connecting heaven and earth. Vibrate with full force: **KHUIT**

8. **Return and Silence:** Step back to your original position. Lower or sheath your implement. Make the Sign of Silence (index finger to lips, eyes downcast).

9. **Face Partner:** Both practitioners rotate to face each other across the circle's diameter.

**Timing Note:** The entire opening should flow as one continuous gesture-poem, taking approximately 2-3 minutes. Each vibration should resonate through your body and the temple space.

---

#### Part II: The Invocatory Dialogues

The following verses are delivered as a ritual dialogue, with RHK and AFNK speaking in turn. Maintain eye contact when addressing your partner. Speak clearly and with conviction.

**Verse 1 - RHK Speaks:**

> The opener of door-leaves, necromancer from Khonsu,
> Be strong of arm and true of voice, and speak ma'a-heru!

**Verse 2 - AFNK Responds:**

*Deliver with devotional intensity, offering yourself to the solar force:*

> My praise to thee, Exalted One, o ye fiery of breath!
> My heart is thine, your Sun is mine, now pierce the veil of Death!
> Grant me the crown of Ra!
> Maketh the way for my Ba!
> And Shadow of mine, be it seen that I shine,
> The Ka of the word of the Law!

> By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.
> Abide by me, Ra-hoor-khu-it,
> For now I break the seal of Hell!

**Verse 7 - RHK:**

6. **Stand in silence** for several breaths, feeling the opened gateway

---

### Post-Ritual Protocol

**Immediate Integration (5-10 minutes):**
- Remain in the temple space in contemplative silence
- Feel the presence of the opened gate
- Notice any shifts in perception, energy, or awareness
- Avoid speaking unless necessary

**Grounding & Closing:**
- The gate remains open for your magickal work
- When your working is complete, consider performing a closing ritual:
  - Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)
  - General closing of the quarters
  - A simple thanks and dismissal to the forces invoked
- Ground fully: eat, drink water, touch the earth
- Record your experience immediately in your practice log

**Safety Considerations:**
- This is an OPENING ritual - it does not include a closing mechanism
- Do not perform this ritual casually or without serious intent
- Ensure you have adequate protection and grounding practices
- If you feel overwhelmed, perform the LBRP immediately
- Have a trusted magical partner or emergency plan if working solo
- Do not perform if mentally, emotionally, or physically depleted

**When to Perform:**
- Before significant magickal operations requiring chthonic or underworld connections
- During liminal times (equinoxes, dark moon, midnight)
- When seeking to communicate with Qliphothic, underworld, or ancestor spirits
- As part of extended temple work requiring sustained access to the Duat

**When NOT to Perform:**
- If you feel unstable, ungrounded, or vulnerable
- Without adequate protection and closing rituals available
- In spaces you don't control or can't properly cleanse afterward
- Without understanding the implications of opening underworld gates

### Safety Check-In Questions

Ask yourself these questions after each performance, especially in early practices:

- [ ] Am I adequately grounded and back in my body?
- [ ] Do I feel safe and protected in my space?
- [ ] Are there any attachments or entities that need to be addressed?
- [ ] Am I able to close/banish if needed, or do I need support?
- [ ] Is my everyday functioning intact and stable?
- [ ] Do I have someone to contact if integration becomes difficult?

**If you answer "no" or feel uncertain about any of these, prioritize grounding, protection, and potentially seeking guidance from a trusted magical practitioner or teacher.**
