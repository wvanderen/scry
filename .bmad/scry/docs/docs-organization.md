## Documentation Principles

- **Practice-generated**: Documents created during actual magical practice and ritual work
- **Living documents**: Updated as practice evolves and deepens
- **Personal nature**: Contains individual's spiritual journey and experiences
- **Module-specific**: Pertains specifically to Scry magical practice system

## vs. Project Documentation

Project-level documentation (`/docs/` at project root) contains:
- Product requirements and development planning
- Technical architecture and system design
- Development epics and user stories
- Testing documentation
- Project management artifacts

This separation maintains clear boundaries between:
- **Development** (project-level) vs **Practice** (module-level)
- **Technical** vs **Spiritual** documentation
- **Planning** vs **Execution** records
