## Personal Information

### Identity
- **Full Name:** William Van Deren
- **Preferred Name:** Lem
- **Pronouns:** he/they

### Personal Bio
Lem began his spiritual journey with an innate sense that reality extends beyond what meets the eye. During college, he explored Daoism and Buddhism, establishing a foundation in meditation that continues to serve his practice. His path then evolved toward Western esoteric traditions, and over the past decade, he has explored numerous traditions while finding his strongest resonance with Thelema, though he maintains a syncretic approach that allows for continual evolution and personal discovery.

As both practitioner and creator, Lem is developing the Scry application to elevate his own practice while serving others, embodying the integration of technology and spirituality that has been important to him for many years. His current practice includes temple work (returning after a hiatus), scrying practices, devotional work with Hekate, and Thelemic initiatory work, including ritual collaboration with entities.

His immediate goals focus on building consistency and depth - strengthening his meditation practice and increasing his capacity for more advanced work. Long-term, he aims to undertake his own version of the Abramelin working, viewing Scry as an essential tool for this transformational journey.
