I see a descending spiral staircase. Spirits of the dead wish to enter
THROUGH_THE_SCREEN
Past process - repeatedly had visions materialize not into physical sense. Flashing scenes of entryways to underworld. Hekate is inviting us down through that portal. 
The underworld is a state of mind we can enter through the circle. Around you is a physical and non-physical container, navgiate this as your threshold. 
Etheric mist coating entire space, has charged entire air around us
Hekate's face in altar cloth - old woman white hair pointing downward
Instructed to stand and turn the key in door. Walls are distorted, chapel perikous. Insstructed again to sit and receive. Pressure astral not wanting ot manifest into physcality. Hekate wants to be seen and can break the rules of reality if she wants to
Watching my own reflection and see behind a tall and mounting shadow - emerges as if holding a torch
Pushes against the treshold as if testing the water
Etheric mists are around us
"Rise to meet me child" 
Phsyical shadow move cat like accross the floor, not a cat
Feels as if she's hiding around us but what behind I do not know
This is coming forth through the wall
Oh shiii
Saw her shining clthonic regalia coming out through the wall
Left corner behind the bookshelf - manifestation point
Our presence and perception of the astral around us gives her matrix on which to materialize. Coming out of the astral into the physical
Continue to grow th matrix - orb in front of and above us. Orb of containment around us
Before she was doing old lady witch now she appears in a comely form
Allow the matrix of materialization. Veil between worlds is so thin. 
Sucked through a wall. Very much wihtin a different place yet also here, superimposed on each other. 
Walking up through a graveyard towards me. A silver figure, ready to step out. 
We have lost entry to that threshold.
We could all go on astral journey without even leaving the room. 
A creature with hounds fangs, wide eyes. "you've seen enough" 

## Integration

1. Repeatability - what strengthened the Matrix
- The devotional and all the names, as well as the mantra helped us enter ecstatic static
- AI was acting as almost inducing a hypnotic trance or someone doing a guided medition
- No seperation between literal and imagined
- Scrying media were potent manifestation mediums. Crystal ball was potentiator and fixed point of concentration for multiple operators. 
- Incense and offerings strengthen connection
- Nature of the working (Hekate in particular is good for these kinds of workings, liminality)
- Weakening: emotions or break of concentration or break of unity of group mind

2. Safety boundaries - totally protective in this case as Hekate is beneficient
3. They were just places in the space where all the stuff was manifesting. It felt like where stuff was happening in the room.
