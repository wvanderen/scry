---

## ROLES

**Seer (Scryer):** Receives visions, works with crystal ball, speaks Babalon's words

---

## SETUP (Both prepare together)

**Left Altar:** Red cloth, cup of red wine, red roses, Babalon sigil, red candle
**Center:** Crystal ball on red cushion, surrounded by rose petals

## PHASE I: OPENING

**Magus:** Performs Qabalistic Cross, then LBRP to purify space

**Magus (proclaims):** *"I consecrate this temple as gateway between worlds. Let the veils grow thin, let the Scarlet Woman ride forth into this sacred space."*

---

## PHASE II: CONSECRATION

**Magus (at Right Altar):** Traces **unicursal invoking hexagram** before Triangle, vibrates *"ARARITA!"*

**Magus:** *"This Triangle becomes the throne of Babalon. By authority of True Will, I declare this Triangle consecrated to BABALON, the Scarlet Woman!"*

**Magus:** Places scarlet cord around Triangle perimeter

**Magus (at Left Altar):** Lifts cup of wine

**Magus:** *"This cup becomes the Grail of Babalon. Let this wine become the sacrament of the Scarlet Woman."*

**Magus:** Makes **invoking pentagram of Fire** over cup, vibrates *"BABALON!"*, returns it to altar

---

## PHASE III: THE GREAT INVOCATION

**Magus (before crystal, facing Triangle):** Arms raised, palms forward

**Magus (vibrates):** *"BABALON! BABALON! BABALON!"*

**Magus:** *"I call thee forth from the City of Pyramids! Come forth, thou Scarlet Woman, Lady of the Grail, Mother of Abominations!"*

**Magus:** *"I invoke thee by thy secret names: BABALON! By the power of IAO! By the formula of ARARITA!"*

**Magus:** *"Come forth into this Triangle of Arte! Appear unto us! Speak through the crystal! Fill this temple with thy terrible beauty!"*

**Magus:** *"OL SONUF VAORESAJI, BABALON! Come forth in power and manifestation!"*

**Magus (with passion):** *"BABALON, appear unto us! Manifest within this Triangle! Speak through the crystal! We are thy servants, thy willing chalices. Come unto us, now and ever more!"*

---

## PHASE IV: THE COMMUNION

**Magus (to Seer):** *"The way is open. Begin the scrying."*

**Seer:** Softens gaze upon crystal ball, enters light trance state

**Seer (speaks softly):** *"Great Babalon, we have called and thou hast answered. Show thyself in the crystal. Grant us vision, grant us communion."*

**Seer:** Gazes into crystal, receives visions/communications

**Magus:** Maintains sacred space, monitors energy flow, may softly chant *"Babalon"* if presence needs strengthening

**When communication is established:**

**Seer:** Speaks Babalon's words, shares visions, channels messages
**Magus:** May ask questions, make offerings, facilitate deeper communion

**Magus (when communion feels complete):** *"The communion is complete. Prepare for the sacrament."*

---

## PHASE V: THE SACRAMENT

**Magus:** *"This cup is the cup of BABALON. In it is mingled the blood of the saints. We drink, and thereby partake of Her essence."*

**Magus drinks first, then offers to Seer**

**Seer:** *"I have drunk from the Grail. I am transformed. The communion is complete."*

**Both:** Visualize crimson light filling entire bodies

---

## PHASE VI: SEALING

**Magus:** *"Great Babalon, we give thanks for thy presence, wisdom, and love. The veil between us has grown thin, and we have beheld thy glory."*

**Magus:** *"Remain ever accessible to us. Let this temple be a gateway. When we call, answer. When we seek, appear."*

**Magus:** *"Hail unto thee, BABALON! Io Babalon! Amor sub voluntate!"*

**Magus:** *"Depart now in peace, great Babalon, unto thy throne beyond the Abyss. We release thee from this Triangle. Go in peace, that thou mayest return when called. Ave atque vale!"*

---

## PHASE VII: CLOSING

**Magus:** Performs Qabalistic Cross

**Magus:** Performs LBRP to close space

**Magus:** Extinguishes candles in reverse order (Right, then Left)

**Magus:** *"The rite is ended. The temple is sealed. That which was opened is closed. Yet the connection remains. So it is done."*

## TWO-POPERSON COORDINATION NOTES

**During Invocation:** Magus maintains focus while Seer begins entering trance state early

**During Communion:** Magus protects space, Seer focuses entirely on receiving. No cross-talk unless Magus needs to clarify or deepen the connection

**Energy Flow:** Magus directs outward energy (invocation), Seer receives inward energy (visions)

**Grounding:** After ritual, both ground together—share experiences, drink water, touch earth

*Love is the law, love under will.*
