# Usage Notes for Agents:
# - Always cross-reference planetary and elemental correspondences for enhanced timing
# - Consider both number correspondence and planetary rulership for ritual planning
# - Moon phase modifies all other correspondences
# - Personal astrology (natal chart) can override general recommendations
# - Intent and preparation matter more than perfect timing
