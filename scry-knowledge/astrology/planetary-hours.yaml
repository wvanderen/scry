# Planetary Hour Calculations
# Each planetary hour = (daylight duration or night duration) / 12
# Hour length changes throughout the year based on daylight hours

hour_calculation:
  method: "Varies by location and season"
  example_calculation: |
    "If sunrise is 6:00 AM and sunset is 6:00 PM:
     Daylight duration = 12 hours
     Each daylight hour = 60 minutes
     Each nighttime hour = 60 minutes

     If sunrise is 6:00 AM and sunset is 8:00 PM:
     Daylight duration = 14 hours
     Each daylight hour = 70 minutes
     Each nighttime hour = 50 minutes"
